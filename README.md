### SimpleShell
Is a project of simple helper shell scripts. No licence is intended.

### Contributions
Contributions are very welcome, things to keep it clean:
- Write a self explaining script, so no need for man pages.
- Please note the .editorconfig, while editting your files. You might be able to use this file to auto format if your editor supports a package/add-on for it.

That's it.
