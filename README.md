### SimpleShell
Is a project of simple helper shell scripts. No licence is intended.

### Contributions
Contributions are welcome, but there are rules:
- Take necessary precautions in your script to prevent unwanted behavior.
- Start your script with comments.
  - Write a title on top of your script.
  - Add a description of what it does.
  - Add the usage.
- Formatting should be as follows
  - Your lines should not exceed 80 columns.
  - New lines should start 2 spaces inside of a regular line.
  - There should be a space between **#** and _your comment_.

Your comments may look something like this:
```
# Git Reset
# Description: Warning! This script removes your last <howManyCommitsBack>
#   commits. Your local files will also be reverted or even REMOVED! So take 
#   extra care using this script.
# Usage: ./gitReset.sh <howManyCommitsBack>
```

That's all for now.
